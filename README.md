# Codee App
Codee (**Code** **e**ditor) - Mobile IDE for developing Kotlin, Java and other projects. Fully written on Kotlin!
## 🚀 Motivation
There are currently no good and flexible development environments for Android-based mobile devices, so this application will have to solve this problem.
## 📐 Plugins
All plugins are powered by Kotlin Script. So far we have only made a small prototype API that does almost nothing in the [plugin-api](plugin-api). Plugin examples you can see [here](https://github.com/codee-team/codee-plugin-examples) (not actual for now, there is example with old API).
## 💡 TODO
- Convenient and flexible API for plugins
- Clear and beautiful interface
- Code editor without lags (as much as possible)
- Default plugins for Kotlin & Java
- Gradle support (as plugin)
## 📄 License
This application is absolutely free and using [MIT](https://github.com/codee-team/codee-app/blob/master/LICENSE) license.
